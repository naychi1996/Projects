        <h3><a href="https://naychi1996.github.io/PawsTies/">PawsTies</a></h3>
        <p>PawsTies is programmed with bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. To achieve the online subscription look for the front-end, I utilized Navbar bootstrap, section tag, id attributes to organize categories and linked them to href attributes of the Navbar. I wanted the testimonial's slides to be active, so I used the carousel bootstrap in the class attributes. The website is for dog owners to make new friends with other dog owners so that their dogs can become besties aka PawsTies or more.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://naychi1996.github.io/Dicee/">Dicee</a></h3>
        <p>Dicee is developed with DOM, javascript, HTML, and CSS. I utilized Math.floor() and Math.random() methods to generate random numbers whenever players refresh the browser to play the dice game. DOM is then used to replace with random pictures of the dice. If else statements are used to determine who wins, loses, or a draw.</p>

        <h3> <a href="https://naychi1996.github.io/DrumKit/">Drum Kit</a> </h3>
        <p>Drum Kit is programmed with DOM, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Drum Kit is to let users play the drum with a keyboard. In order to achieve that, I utilized a switch statement to link each keyboard letter with different audios. I used DOM to detect when any of the buttons are clicked to trigger a function.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://naychi1996.github.io/SimonGame/">Simon Game</a></h3>
        <p>Simon Game is programmed with jQuery, DOM, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The game starts by flashing a random color among four, and the player has to follow it by clicking on colors those flashed in the correct order as the game flashes one color for each level. This game is programmed with arrays and push method to compare the game's clicked pattern with the user's clicked pattern. I used jQuery to locate any changes in each level for replacements. I coded functions of nextSequence(), makeSound(), animatePress(), and checkAnswer() to complied it like the Simon Game.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://polar-fjord-35641.herokuapp.com/">Daily Journal</a></h3>
        <p>Daily Journal is programmed with Node.js, Express, EJS, Mongoose, Javascript, bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. I deployed Daily Journal with Heroku, and it is programmed to compose posts and render it on the Home page with a delete button. The compose page is designed to add new posts, which will also add to the MongoDB database as a new document. Read More anchor tag is used to take you to the post.ejs page rendering the correct post using the publish._id.</p>

        <p>Newsletter Subscription is programmed with Express, Node.js Request Module, Mailchimp, Javascript, bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. Newsletter Subscription is programmed to collect names and correct email formats of subscribers. It uses Mailchimp to store the data and is deployed with Heroku. If the user enters an incorrect email or tries to subscribe with the same email twice, they will be rendered to the error page to try again. If their information is recorded successfully in Mailchimp, they will be rendered to the success page.</p>

The user can create new sheets of To Do List to organize by typing a title at the end of the URL. New documents are created with Schema and are stored in MongoDB every time the user adds an item.
